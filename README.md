## üí° Known Issues

- Some Epoch quests still have placeholder data - please use /qdc enable to help collect data
- Map icons may not appear for quests with incomplete NPC/object data
- Project Epoch has modified numerous vanilla quests to be cross-faction, causing conflicts with the original database
- Modified vanilla quests may trigger "missing quest" alerts even though they exist (due to significant changes from original)
