## v1.0.55 - Latest Release

### üéØ Major Fixes

#### Data Collection Now Works for ALL Custom Quests! 
- **Fixed Issue #21**: Runtime stubbed quests (like the new troll starting zone) are now properly detected
- **Fixed Issue #27**: No more [DATA] message spam - debug messages only show when explicitly enabled
- Quest ID tracking expanded to ALL Epoch quests (26000+) with no upper limit
- Export window now correctly shows all tracked quests

### üöÄ Key Improvements

#### Better User Experience
- Clear "Ready!" message when data collector is initialized
- Export window shows [COMPLETE] or [INCOMPLETE] status for each quest
- Partial quest data can now be exported (even incomplete quests are valuable!)
- Debug messages properly hidden unless `/qdc debug` is used

#### What This Means for Players
- **New Troll Starting Zone**: Quest 28722 "The Darkspear Tribe" and all other new quests are now tracked
- **Less Spam**: You won't see constant [DATA] messages unless you want them
- **All Data Matters**: Even if you don't complete a quest, the partial data helps improve the database

### üìù How to Use Data Collection

1. Enable data collection: `/qdc enable`
2. Wait for "Ready!" message after reload
3. Accept any custom Epoch quest
4. See "Missing Epoch quest detected!" alert
5. Export data anytime with `/qdc export`

## üí° Known Issues

- Some Epoch quests still have placeholder data - please use /qdc enable to help collect data
- Map icons may not appear for quests with incomplete NPC/object data
- Project Epoch has modified numerous vanilla quests to be cross-faction, causing conflicts with the original database
